### **Hotel Booking Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Comparison**

This analysis explores a hotel booking dataset, implementing various machine learning models to predict booking status. The goal is to understand the data, preprocess it, and evaluate multiple models for accuracy and performance. Hereâ€™s an updated summary of the exploration and model comparison.



### **1. Basic Understanding of the Data**

#### **Data Types**

*   **Continuous Variables**:

    *   Lead Time

    *   Average Price Per Room

*   **Categorical Variables**:

    *   Meal Plans

    *   Room Type Reserved

    *   Market Segment Type

    *   Repeated Guest

    *   Required Car Parking Space

*   **Non-Categorical Variables**:

    *   Adults

    *   Children

    *   Stays Weekends

    *   Stays Weeks

    *   Arrival Year

    *   Arrival Month

    *   Arrival Date

    *   Number of Previous Bookings Cancelled

    *   Number of Previous Bookings Not Cancelled

    *   Number of Special Requests



### **2. Data Preprocessing**

The dataset was loaded and processed using the following steps:

*   Column names were standardized for clarity.

*   Categorical variables were identified and encoded where necessary.

*   Continuous variables were scaled using a **StandardScaler** for better performance in some machine learning models.

*   The data was split into training and testing sets.



### **3. Machine Learning Model Evaluation**

#### **Logistic Regression**

*   **Accuracy**: 78.2%

*   **Classification Report**:

    *   Precision: 0.78 (for both classes)

    *   Recall: 0.78 (for both classes)

    *   F1-Score: 0.78 (for both classes)

*   **Key Observations**:

    *   Logistic Regression provides a baseline accuracy of 78%, which is decent for a linear model. It performs similarly on both classes.



#### **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

*   **Accuracy**: 84.0% (with all data), 84.0% (with 30% data)

*   **Training Time**: 4.32 seconds

*   **Prediction Time**: 4.53 seconds

*   **Classification Report**:

    *   Precision: 0.84 (for both classes)

    *   Recall: 0.84 (for both classes)

    *   F1-Score: 0.84 (for both classes)

*   **Key Observations**:

    *   The SVM model shows significant improvement over Logistic Regression, achieving 84% accuracy. It works well even when trained on a subset of the data (30%), reducing training time without losing performance.



#### **Decision Tree Classifier**

*   **Accuracy**: 89.0%

*   **Training Time**: 0.0041 seconds

*   **Prediction Time**: 0.004 seconds

*   **Classification Report**:

    *   Precision: 0.87 (for class 0), 0.91 (for class 1)

    *   Recall: 0.91 (for class 0), 0.87 (for class 1)

    *   F1-Score: 0.89 (for both classes)

*   **Key Observations**:

    *   Decision Trees perform very well with 89% accuracy and are extremely fast during both training and prediction phases. The model exhibits a balanced performance across both classes.



#### **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

*   **Accuracy**: 89.8%

*   **Prediction Time**: 12.99 seconds

*   **Classification Report**:

    *   Precision: 0.86 (for class 0), 0.95 (for class 1)

    *   Recall: 0.95 (for class 0), 0.85 (for class 1)

    *   F1-Score: 0.90 (for both classes)

*   **Key Observations**:

    *   KNN achieves a higher accuracy (89.8%) than Decision Trees. However, it has slower prediction times, especially when using larger data. Despite this, it provides high precision for class 1 and strong overall performance.



#### **AdaBoost (with Decision Tree as base estimator)**

*   **Accuracy**: 92.5%

*   **Training Time**: 9.0 seconds

*   **Prediction Time**: 0.3 seconds

*   **Classification Report**:

    *   Precision: 0.91 (for class 0), 0.94 (for class 1)

    *   Recall: 0.94 (for class 0), 0.91 (for class 1)

    *   F1-Score: 0.93 (for both classes)

*   **Key Observations**:

    *   AdaBoost achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 92.5%. It provides a good balance between precision and recall for both classes. Training time is longer than Decision Trees and SVM, but the prediction time is fast.



### **4. Summary of Best Performers**

*   **Best Model**: **AdaBoost Classifier** with Decision Tree as the base estimator (92.5% accuracy).

*   **Other Strong Models**: **Decision Tree Classifier** (89%), **K-Nearest Neighbors** (89.8%).

*   **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** are solid models, but AdaBoost outperforms them in terms of accuracy.
